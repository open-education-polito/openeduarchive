# 4. Content creation is strictly tied to communities

Date: 2024-02-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Content creation and communities

## Decision

Content creation is strictly tied to communities. This means that it is not possible anymore to create content without associating it with a community. 

## Consequences

Since each community is responsible for the content it creates, this decision will help to keep the content organized and will make it easier to manage the content. The main consequence is that *every content* will undergo a deep review process by the community before being published. This will help to maintain the quality of the content and will prevent the publication of low-quality/unproper content.
