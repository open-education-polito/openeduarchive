# 2. Migrate to 12.0.0b1

Date: 2024-02-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Migration to a new version of InvenioRDM.

## Decision

We migrated to the 12.0.0b1 version of InvenioRDM.

## Consequences

This means we will abandon the v11 with all the consequences. v12 seems relatively stable and for the POC seems like the best thing to adopt, also seeing the advanced configurations available directly through the invenio.cfg file.
